# cine-file
The server-side component of a "movies" web application that allows the user to create an account and search a movie database with information about different movies, directors and genres as well as sign-up and edit profile information

*The complete server-side of your web application, including the server, business logic,
and business layers of the application. It will consist of a well-designed REST API and
architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API
will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods
(CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational
way.*
